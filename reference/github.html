  <p>Here are some tips for getting your GitHub environment working correctly, and troubleshooting when things go wrong.
  </p>
  <h3 id="stepsforcreatinganewrepository">Steps for creating a new repository</h3>
  <p>Git is kinda like Dropbox, but for code files. Git&nbsp;<em>repositories</em>&nbsp;are folders on your computer that
    have&nbsp;<em>magic powers</em>. These powers include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The ability to automatically synchronize files within the folder between your computer and GitHub.com</li>
    <li>Watching for changes you make to files, then giving you the ability to either move forward with those changes, or
      revert back</li>
    <li>Lots more, but those are the important ones...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In order to convert an ordinary folder on your computer into a magic one (i.e. turn it from a folder into
    a&nbsp;<em>repository</em>), follow these&nbsp;<strong>one-time</strong>&nbsp;steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Drag the folder from Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) into the GitHub app.</li>
    <li>When asked to create a repository, do it!</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Once you've got yourself a repository, you can then:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Make some changes to file within your directory (i.e. create, modify, or delete files)</li>
    <li>Type a commit message that describes the change (something like "my first commit") and hit the
      <em>Commit</em>&nbsp;button.</li>
    <li>Hit the "publish repository" button and follow the prompt on the window that appears. (Windows) If you don't see
      your GitHub username on this window, be sure to use the dropdown and select it.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Your mild-mannered, ordinary folder is now a REPOSITORY and fully synchronized with GitHub! <em>There's no need to
      repeat these steps</em> once it's done properly.</p>
  <h3 id="synchronizingchanges">Synchronizing changes</h3>
  <p>Once your repository is created, the GitHub desktop app is always watching. If it detects that anything has changed
    in your repository folder, you'll see those changes in the GitHub app. To move those changes to GitHub.com (where
    everyone can see them), you'll want to commit-and-sync.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Type a commit message, describing the changes you made (for example, "added something awesome!") and hit
      the&nbsp;<em>Commit</em>&nbsp;button.</li>
    <li>Hit the "sync" or "push origin" button.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You'll know everything went right if you see your changes at GitHub.com. Remember that your account at GitHub.com is
    public - if you can see it, I can see it... everyone can see it!</p>
  <h3 id="dontbethatguygal">Don't be that guy/gal</h3>
  <p>We will be creating a lot of code projects this quarter. You'll want to create a&nbsp;<em>new folder</em>, and
    subsequently, a&nbsp;<em>new repository</em> for each one of these projects. Your public website on GitHub is one of
    them. When we move on to creating new projects (e.g. CSS. team page, weather, poker, etc.), each one of these is a
    <em>new repository</em>. Tips for avoiding trouble:</p>
  <p><strong>Don't put magic folders (repositories) inside other magic folders!!!</strong>&nbsp;I cannot stress this
    enough. If your directory structure on your computer looks like this:</p>
  <pre><code>Your Code Directory
  -- mysite
     -- mysecondsite
     -- myteam
     -- weather
     -- poker
  </code></pre>
  <p>... you will be sad. When we create new applications in class, be sure to create a new folder that lives directly
    underneath your code directory, and create a new GitHub repository for each one of them. Like this:</p>
  <pre><code>Your Code Directory
  -- mysite<br />-- mysecondsite
  -- myteam
  -- weather
  -- poker</code></pre>
  <h3>Synchronizing changes using Visual Studio Code</h3>
  <p>I mentioned this as an alternative during class &ndash; you can do everything you can do with the GitHub Desktop app
    using Visual Studio Code's built-in source control tools instead.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In the left-hand sidebar in Visual Studio Code, click the "Source Control" icon... that's the third one from the
      top.</li>
    <li>Click the three dots -&gt; Stage All Changes</li>
    <li>Write a commit message, hit the check mark ✔️to commit</li>
    <li>Click the three dots -&gt; Push</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I'd recommend you at least try it this way once or twice. The GitHub Desktop app is great for getting started with
    Git; doing it in VSCode is more along the lines of how a professional developer might do the same things.</p>

  ### Cloning an existing repository
  
  - Source Control (SCM) in left-hand sidebar
  - "Clone Repository"
  - Enter GitHub repository URL, e.g. https://github.com/eng/hello-html
  - Select a folder – find "code" folder and "Select Repository Location" - this will create a new subfolder with all the
  code from the repository
  - Would you like to open the cloned repository? Select "Open"
  
  If the repository is in your own GitHub account, you can push changes to it!
  
  - Make some changes
  - In SCM sidebar, you'll see a list of those changes. Enter a commit message – i.e. a description of the work you've
  done – and hit the check mark.
  - The first time you do this, you'll see a message that no changes are staged. Hit "always" to continue.
  - Changes are now committed and ready to push back to GitHub. Three dots... push.
  - Repeat this process often! Don't wait until you're done.
