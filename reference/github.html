## Committing with VSCode and GitHub

### Cloning an existing repository

- Source Control (SCM) in left-hand sidebar
- "Clone Repository"
- Enter GitHub repository URL, e.g. https://github.com/eng/hello-html
- Select a folder – find "code" folder and "Select Repository Location" - this will create a new subfolder with all the code from the repository
- Would you like to open the cloned repository? Select "Open"

If the repository is in your own GitHub account, you can push changes to it!

- Make some changes
- In SCM sidebar, you'll see a list of those changes. Enter a commit message – i.e. a description of the work you've done – and hit the check mark.
- The first time you do this, you'll see a message that no changes are staged. Hit "always" to continue.
- Changes are now committed and ready to push back to GitHub. Three dots... push.
- Repeat this process often! Don't wait until you're done.
